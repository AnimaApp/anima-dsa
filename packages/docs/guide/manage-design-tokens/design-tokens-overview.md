# Tokens management - overview
Seamlessly integrating Figma and code. 
<br> 
With Anima DSA, design system teams gain full control over their design tokens, allowing designers to dictate how things look in production while relieving developers of the burden of pixel-pushing and design iterations. 

## Benefits 
### Designers
Designers using Anima DSA can effortlessly manage design tokens within Figma. 
- They have the flexibility to pull tokens from the codebase into Figma, ensuring that their design decisions align with the actual implementation.
- By editing design tokens directly in Figma, designers can fine-tune and iterate on the visual aspects of their designs, all while having a real-time preview of how these changes impact the final product.

### Developers
With Anima DSA, developers no longer need to waste time going back and forth with designers, playing the ping pong of design iterations.
- Design token updates made in Figma can be automatically synced with the codebase **through pull requests**
- Ensuring that developers have access to the latest design styles and avoiding the risk of discrepancies between design and implementation.

## The real magic - uniting tokens and components 
By managing your component library with Anima DSA, every change made to design tokens has a cascading effect, automatically updating all components across the codebase and Figma. This synchronization ensures consistency, accuracy, and efficiency throughout the design-to-development process, enabling designers to have greater control over the final product and developers to focus on writing robust code.
