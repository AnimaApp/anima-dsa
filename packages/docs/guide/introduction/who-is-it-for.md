# Who is it for?

Anima DSA is for everyone that are involved in building or consuming a design system

## Design system creators

### Designers {#ds-designers}

- Get a 100% parity between your code components and your design components
  - Same prop names
  - Same design tokens
  - Same responsive behavior  
- Push design changes directly to code, to make sure your designs wonâ€™t get lost in translation

### Developers {#ds-developers}

- Receive PRs to approve design updates, instead of creating the desired changes manually
- Connect your code snippets with Figma components, automatically

## Design system consumers

### Designers {#ds-consumers-designers}

- Designing a new flow? do it knowing:
  - Which components you can reuse from production
  - What requires tweaks from production
  - When you are requesting for a new component to be built
- See your design like your users would see it in production

### Developers {#ds-consumers-developers}

- Got a design to implement?
  - See your code snippets within Figma, to know which component is used in each design
  - Encourage your designers to reuse existing components, instead of rebuilding what already exists in your codebase
