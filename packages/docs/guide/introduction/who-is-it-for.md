# Who is it for?
Anima DSA is for everyone that are involved in building or consuming a design system

## Design system creators

### Designers
- Get a 100% pairty between your code components and your design components
    - Same prop names
    - Same design tokens
    - Same responsive behavior  
- Push design changes directly to code, to make sure your designs wonâ€™t get lost in translation

### Developers
- Recive PRs to approve design updates, instead of creating the wanted changes manually 
- Connect your code snippets with Figma components, automatically 

## Design system consumers
### Designers 
- Designing a new flow? do it knowing:
    - Which components you can reuse from production
    - What requires tweaks from production
    - When you are requesting for a new component to be built
- See your design like your users would see it in production

### Developers
- Got a design to implement? 
    - See your code snippets within Figma, to know which component is used in each design
    - Encourage your designers to reuse existing components, instead of rebuilding what already exists in your codebase
