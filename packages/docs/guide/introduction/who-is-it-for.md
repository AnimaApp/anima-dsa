## Who can Anima DSA Benefit?
### Designers
- See all of the components in your developer’s codebase mapped out in Figmaincluding all variants defined in the code 
- Know what your users are actually seeing in production
- Push design changes directly to code, to make sure your designs won’t get lost in translation

### Developers
- Encourage your designers to reuse existing components, instead of rebuilding what already exists in your codebase 
- Know which component is used in each design (is there a similar component I can use in my code base?).
- Recice PRs to approve design updates, instead of creating the wanted changes manually
