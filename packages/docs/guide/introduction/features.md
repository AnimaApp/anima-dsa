# Features


## Generate Figma components automatically
Use Anima CLI or URL import to generate your entire code components library as a Figma library, in a single click. 
Anima will translate all of your components (as they are represented in Storybook), as native Figma components. 

### With variants matching code props
Each component property will be translated to a Figma property ![image](https://github.com/AnimaApp/anima-storybook-cli/assets/96059044/aa7d5e90-8519-4ffe-be00-4e944ffb6435)

### With Figma's Auto-layout matching CSS layout
Anima will convert the CSS flex properties into Figma Auto layout, automatically

### With media-queries as Figma variants
Got components that looks differently on different screens? We got you covered. 
When importing your component to Figma, you'd be able to define which viewports you'd like to see in Figma. Anima will add a "Viewport" size property to your component, with all selected sized

### Code snippets embedded in instances
Know if the selected component exists in your source code, and which properties are in use in the selected instance

With a simple connection, you'd be able to pull and push design changes from Figma to GitHub and vice versa.
