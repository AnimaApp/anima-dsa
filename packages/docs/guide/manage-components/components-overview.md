# Overview

Use Anima DSA to create a single source of truth between your code components and your Figma components

## The problem

We have 1 library in code, 1 in Figma, and multiple frustrated designers and developers

## The solution

1. Import your existing component into Figma to create a unified language between design and code.
2. The design and development teams can iterate on the design system, with production as a starting point.

## The result

Code Component == Figma components

1. Same names
2. Same responsive behavior
3. Same styles (via [Design Tokens](/guide/manage-design-tokens/design-tokens-overview))
4. Same variants

## Next steps

Your Figma and code are in sync? great!
Now you can ease handoffs, manage your Design Tokens, and create new components with Anima.
