# Overview
Use Anima DSA to create a single source of truth between your code components and your Figma components

## The problem
We have 1 library in code, 1 in Figma, and multiple frustrated designers and developers


## The solution
1. Import your existing component into Figma to create a unified language between design and code.
2. The design and development teams can iterate on the design system, with prosuction as a starting poing


## The result
Code Component == Figma components
1. Same names
2. Same responsive behavior
3. Save styles (tokens)
4. Same variants
See [Full featurs list](features.md)

## Nexxt steps
Your Figma and code are in sync? great!
Now you can ease handoffs, manage your design tokens, and create new components with Anima.
