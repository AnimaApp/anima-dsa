# Design Tokens Validator

Design tokens are becoming more commonplace as a tool to help provide a consistent way of managing design system attributes.

By having tokens that conform to [Design Tokens Standard](https://design-tokens.github.io/community-group/format/#introduction), you ensure that your tokens will be interoperable across a suite of different design system management platforms, like Anima.

You can validate your design tokens using Anima's online [Design Tokens Validator](https://animaapp.github.io/design-token-validator-site/)
